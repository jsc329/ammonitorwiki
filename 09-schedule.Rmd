# Chapter Introduction

The **schedule** table may be used by smartphone monitoring programs. This table links each piece of equipment (e.g., a smartphone with an **account**) to its associated Google Calendar, and contains entries specifying when audio recordings or photos should be collected. The **schedule** table stores both past and future calendar entries. **AMMonitor** functions create future calendar entries that can be pushed to the Google cloud on a daily basis via a Google API key. When the phone connects to a cellular or Wi-Fi network, its calendar is synced with Google Calendar. Calendar entries then act as triggers that engage the smartphone's camera or audio apps, providing instructions on when to collect data (see Donovan et al. in prep for details). 

Historical calendar entries stored in the **schedule** table are useful for comparing scheduled events with the recordings or photos delivered to the **AMMonitor** cloud-based storage. **AMMonitor** functions can compare expected vs. actual deliveries to identify potential equipment failure. We describe these functions in Chapter 11: Recordings. 

As with the **temporals** table in the previous chapter, we interact with the **schedule** table via specific **AMMonitor** functions rather than with SQLite syntax. In this chapter, we review two ways to generate schedules: at times staggered around sunrise and sunset using the `scheduleSun()` function, or at user-specified times of day with the `scheduleFixed()` function. In the next chapter, **prioritization**, we describe a third way to set the schedule using an optimization scheme based on target species monitoring priorities [@BalanticTemporal].

We begin by using the `dbCreateSample()` function to create a database called "Chap9.sqlite", which will be stored in a folder (directory) called **database** within the **AMMonitor** main directory, which should be your working directory in R. Recall that `dbCreateSample()` generates all tables of an **AMMonitor** database, and then pre-populates sample data into tables specified by the user. For demonstration purposes, we will only pre-populate a few necessary tables below: 

```{r}
# Create a sample database for this chapter
dbCreateSample(db.name = "Chap9.sqlite", 
               file.path = paste0(getwd(),"/database"), 
               tables =  c('locations', 'deployment',
                           'equipment', 'schedule',
                           'accounts', 'people'))
```

We begin by connecting to the database. First, we initialize a character object, **db.path**, that holds the database's full file path. Then, we create a database connection object, **conx**, using RSQLite's `dbConnect()` function, where we identify the SQLite driver in the ‘drv’ argument, and our **db.path** object in the ‘dbname’ argument:

```{r}
# Establish the database file path as db.path
db.path <- paste0(getwd(), '/database/Chap9.sqlite')

# Connect to the database
conx <- RSQLite::dbConnect(drv = dbDriver('SQLite'), dbname = db.path)
```

Finally, we send a SQL statement that will enforce foreign key constraints. 
```{r}
# Turn the SQLite foreign constraints on
RSQLite::dbSendQuery(conn = conx, statement = "PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;")
```

# Introduction to the Schedule Table

The **schedule** table tracks monitoring events assigned to smartphone monitoring equipment. Scheduled events are synced to Google Calendar, and include acoustic recordings, timed photographs, or motion-triggered photographs that can be used for natural resource monitoring.

If you use Google Calendar, the fields in the **schedule** table will look familiar:

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/googlecal.PNG', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.1. Adding an event in Google Calendar brings up this dialogue box.*


Each phone's Google Calendar will be populated with information stored in the **schedule** table. Below, we use `dbTables()` to view the metadata for this table. 

```{r}
# Look at information about the schedule table
dbTables(db.path = db.path, table = "schedule")
```

The **schedule** table contains 11 fields. The *equipmentID*, *locationID*, *subject*, *startDate*, and *startTime* together serve as the primary key (a composite key). These fields, in addition to most of the remaining fields -- *endDate*, *endTime*, *allDayEvent*, *description*, and *private* -- contain information required by the Google Calendar API, and will be generated automatically based on user input fed to the **AMMonitor** functions covered in this chapter. The *subject* field can be set to 'recording', 'photo', or 'motion', and is the vehicle that identifies what type of data should be collected by the smartphone:  'recording' will capture an audio recording, 'photo' will capture a timed photograph, and 'motion' will enable motion-triggered photos, similar to a camera trap. (The *subject* field can also be used to schedule mobile data mode, in which the phones connect to mobile data and sync with cloud-based storage; see Donovan et al. in prep for details). Lastly, the *tz* column records the timezone associated with a particular scheduled event, based on the location of deployed equipment.

We use `dbGetQuery()` to retrieve the records present in our sample **schedule** table:

```{r}
# Retrieve the first 5 sample records stored in the schedule table
schedule <- RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                                statement = "SELECT * 
                                             FROM schedule
                                             LIMIT 5;")

# Display a few selected columns
schedule[, c(1:7, 10)]
```

Observe that an *equipmentID* (which is linked to a specific Google account via the **accounts** table) is assigned to each record. The *locationID* is automatically populated based on the current deployment for that equipment, based on the **deployment** table.

Importantly, the *equipmentID* field maps to the *equipmentID* field in the **equipment** table, and the *locationID* field maps to the *locationID* field in the **locations** table. Thus, both fields serve as foreign keys, which we confirm with the following code:

```{r, eval = T}
# Return foreign key information for the deployment table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "PRAGMA foreign_key_list(schedule);")

```
Note that if the primary key entries in the **equipment** or **locations** tables are updated, changes will cascade to the **schedule** table as well. 


# Setting a sun-based sampling schedule with scheduleSun()

Sun-based sampling allows us to schedule monitoring events that are automatically staggered around sunrise and/or sunset at actively monitored locations. To set a sun-based schedule, we use the **AMMonitor** function `scheduleSun()`. This function was inspired by [Hillary Parker's blog post](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/05/27/sunsets-in-google-calendar-using-r/) on how to create a sunset-based calendar formatted for Google.

The `scheduleSun()` function has multiple arguments, many of which contain default values; some are not required:

```{r}
# View scheduleSun's arguments and defaults
args(scheduleSun)
```

As usual, the 'db.path' argument will take our **db.path** object, which is the full file path to our database. Next, the 'locationID' argument allows us to input a string of locationIDs for which we want to generate sun-based calendars. In this argument, we want to make sure that the string of locationIDs we input actually matches locationIDs present in the **locations** table, and that these locations are currently being actively monitored with a piece of equipment in the **deployment** table. The third argument is 'calendar.key', where we can specify a Google API service token (discussed later). Below, we set 'calendar.key' to NULL to start out by testing the function. In the 'subject' argument, we indicate that this scheduled event will be a "recording". The 'start.date' and 'end.date' arguments allow us to set the limits of the calendar (inclusive) and must be characters in YYYY-mm-dd format. The 'duration' argument is a scalar integer for specifying the recording length in minutes; below, we set a 'duration' of 3 to indicate that each recording should be three minutes long. In 'n.rise', we specify the number of recording events that should be staggered around sunrise; below, we've chosen a value of 3. In 'n.set', we specify the number of recording events that should be staggered around sunset; below we've chosen a value of 2. The 'spacing' argument lets us specify the number of minutes providing space between the end of one recording and the start of the next. In a Wi-Fi or cellular-based monitoring program, we require at least one minute of spacing between recordings to allow the smartphone's internal operations to keep up with the scheduled events. We set the 'db.insert' and 'google.push' options to FALSE to test the function without adding the resulting schedule to the database, and without pushing any events to Google Calendar: 
```{r}
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# If argument 'db.insert' and 'google.push' = FALSE, 
# schedules are created and returned to the user as a data.table 
# for inspection. The schedule is not added to the database, and 
# is not pushed to Google Calendar. A calendar.key is not required.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

scheduleSun(db.path = db.path,
            locationID = c('location@1', 'location@2'),
            calendar.key = NULL,
            subject = 'recording', 
            start.date = '2018-06-01',
            end.date = '2018-06-02',
            duration = 2,
            n.rise = 3,
            n.set = 2,
            spacing = 1,
            db.insert = FALSE,
            google.push = FALSE)
```

In the output, we see that `scheduleSun()` has automatically populated the subject field with the word 'recording'. It has tracked our start and end dates as well as start and end times according to the user inputs we provided. Users can experiment with re-running this function using different inputs for 'duration', 'n.rise', 'n.set', and 'spacing' to observe how the function behaves. 

Once we feel comfortable with the function outputs, we can set the arguments 'db.insert' and 'google.push' to TRUE to create schedules, add them to the database, and finally push them to Google Calendar. 

In order to successfully push to Google Calendar, we need to provide a file.path to the 'calendar.key', which we will discuss below. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# If argument 'db.insert' and 'google.push' = TRUE,
# schedules are created and returned to the user as a 
# data.table, added to the database, and pushed to Google Calendar. 
# A calendar.key is required.
# ------------------------------------------------------------  

scheduleSun(db.path = db.path,
            locationID = c('location@1', 'location@2'),
            calendar.key = 'settings/calendar-10b0fdaac306.json',
            subject = 'recording',
            start.date = '2018-06-01',
            end.date = '2018-06-02',
            duration = 2,
            n.rise = 3, 
            n.set = 2, 
            spacing = 1,
            db.insert = TRUE,
            google.push = TRUE)
```

`scheduleSun()` returns status messages (not shown) informing us as to whether events were successfully uploaded to the Google Calendar and added to the database for each monitoring location. It also returns a data.table of the scheduled events added to the database.

If we change our minds about the events we have added to the Google Calendar, we can delete them using the function `scheduleDelete()`. In addition to the 'db.path' object and the service token 'calendar.key', `scheduleDelete()` requires us to identify the locations and date ranges (inclusive) for which events should be eliminated from the calendar:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Delete events from the Google Calendar itself:
scheduleDelete(db.path = db.path,
               locationID = c('location@1', 'location@2'),
               calendar.key = 'settings/calendar-10b0fdaac306.json',
               start.date = '2018-06-01',
               end.date = '2018-06-02')
```

`scheduleDelete()` will yield status messages to inform us that events were successfully deleted. (View the `scheduleDelete()` helpfile for additional options to delete events directly based on the Google account rather than the locationID.) 

One last option with the `scheduleSun()` function is the capacity to create a sun-based calendar without any database at all. In this case, users can set the 'db.path' argument to NULL. We pass our desired inputs to the 'start.date', 'end.date', 'duration', 'n.rise', 'n.set', and 'spacing' arguments just as we did in the previous examples. However, if we aren't using a database, we have to provide some location names of our choice in the 'locationID' argument (this input is required by Google Calendar), as well as latitude and longitude vectors of the same length as the 'locationID' vector. We also need to identify the 'timezone' argument as an [Olson names-formatted time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). We set 'db.insert' and 'google.push' to FALSE since we aren't working with a database.
```{r}

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Users can create a sun-based calendar independent
# of the database by ignoring the db.path argument and instead
# using the optional lat, long, and timezone arguments.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

scheduleSun(locationID = c('one_place', 'another_place'),
            start.date = '2018-06-01',
            end.date = '2018-06-02',
            duration = 1,
            n.rise = 2,
            n.set = 1,
            spacing = 4,
            lat = c(44.475856, 43.234555),
            long = c(-73.195142, -72.103589), 
            timezone = 'America/New_york',
            db.insert = FALSE,
            google.push = FALSE)
```

In the third example, the field names on the returned data.table object look slightly different from those returned by a call to `scheduleSun()` when working with the database. There are no *locationID* or *equipmentID* columns because we are not linked with a database, and the column names are formatted for direct use with the Google Calendar API (e.g., "Start Date" instead of "startDate", "Location" instead of "locationID"). If desired, we could save this output to an R object, write it to a CSV, and manually load it into a Google Calendar ourselves (or apply it to other uses).

# Setting a fixed sampling schedule with scheduleFixed()

Fixed sampling allows us to schedule audio recording events at the precise times we want to sample. To set a fixed schedule, we use the function `scheduleFixed()`. 

The arguments to `scheduleFixed()` are similar to `scheduleSun()`, except that the sun-based arguments disappear, and we instead have a 'sampling.times' argument that we use to feed fixed sampling times into the function. As usual, the 'db.path' argument will take our **db.path** object, which has stored the full file path to our database. Next, the 'locationID' argument allows us to input a string of locationIDs for which we want to generate fixed calendars. In this argument, since we are using the database, we need to make sure that the string of locationIDs we input actually matches locationIDs present in the **locations** table, and that these locations are currently being actively monitored with a piece of equipment in the **deployment** table. The third argument is 'calendar.key', where we can specify a Google API service token we generated (see below). For now, we set this argument to NULL since we begin with a test of the function. In the 'subject' argument, we indicate that the event should be a "recording". The 'start.date' and 'end.date' arguments allow us to set the limits of the calendar (inclusive) and must be characters in YYYY-mm-dd format. For the 'sampling.times' argument, our character vector of sampling times must be input in hh:mm:ss format using a 24-hour calendar (e.g., we use 20:00:00 to indicate a sampling time at 8pm, rather than 08:00:00, which would indicate a sampling time at 8am). The 'duration' function again specifies how long the recording should be in minutes. Lastly, we set 'db.insert' and 'google.push' to FALSE to test out the function without adding the resulting schedule to the database, or pushing events to Google Calendar:
```{r}

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# If argument 'db.insert' and 'google.push' = FALSE, 
# schedules are created and returned to the user as a data.table 
# for inspection. The schedule is not added to the database, and 
# is not pushed to Google Calendar. A calendar.key is not required.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

scheduleFixed(db.path = db.path,
              locationID = c('location@1', 'location@2'),
              calendar.key = NULL,
              subject = 'recording', 
              start.date = '2018-06-01',
              end.date = '2018-06-02',
              sampling.times = c('06:00:00', '06:30:00', '20:00:00'),
              duration = 1, 
              db.insert = FALSE,
              google.push = FALSE)
```

As before, once we are satisfied with our tests of `scheduleFixed()`, we can set the arguments 'db.insert' and 'google.push' to TRUE to create schedules, add them to the database, and push them to Google Calendar. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# If argument 'db.insert' and 'google.push' = TRUE,
# schedules are created and returned to the user as a 
# data.table, added to the database, and pushed to Google Calendar. 
# A calendar.key is required.
# ------------------------------------------------------------           

scheduleFixed(db.path = db.path,
              locationID = c('location@1', 'location@2'),
              calendar.key = 'settings/calendar-10b0fdaac306.json',
              subject = 'recording', 
              start.date = '2018-06-01',
              end.date = '2018-06-02',
              sampling.times = c('06:00:00', '06:30:00', '20:00:00'),
              duration = 1, 
              db.insert = TRUE,
              google.push = TRUE)
```

`scheduleFixed()` will provide status messages informing us whether events were successfully uploaded to the Google Calendar and added to the database for each monitoring location. It also returns a data.table of the information that was added to the database.

As before, if we change our minds about the fixed events we have added to the Google Calendar, we can delete them using `scheduleDelete()`. In addition to the db.path object and the service token calendar.key, `scheduleDelete()` requires us to identify the locations and date ranges (inclusive) for which events should be eliminated from the calendar:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Delete events from the Google Calendar itself:
scheduleDelete(db.path = db.path,
               locationID = c('location@1', 'location@2'),
               calendar.key = 'settings/calendar-10b0fdaac306.json',
               start.date = '2018-06-01',
               end.date = '2018-06-02') 
```

`scheduleDelete()` yields status messages (not shown) confirming that events were successfully deleted. 

One last option with the `scheduleFixed()` function is the capacity to create a fixed calendar without any database at all. In this case, users can ignore the 'db.path' argument. We pass our desired inputs to the 'start.date', 'end.date', 'sampling.times', and 'duration' arguments just as we did in the previous examples. However, since we aren't using a database, we have to provide some location names of our choice in the 'locationID' argument (required by Google Calendar), as well as latitude and longitude vectors of the same length as the 'locationID' vector. We also need to identify the 'timezone' as an [Olson names-formatted time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). We set 'db.insert' and 'google.push' to FALSE since we aren't working with a database.
```{r}

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Users can create a fixed calendar independent 
# of the database by ignoring the db.path argument and instead 
# using the optional lat, long, and timezone arguments. 
# ------------------------------------------------------------   

scheduleFixed(locationID = 'mylocation', 
              start.date = '2018-06-01',
              end.date = '2018-06-02', 
              sampling.times = c('06:00:00', '06:30:00', '20:00:00'),
              duration = 1, 
              lat = 33.6178, 
              long = -114.5883, 
              timezone = 'America/Los_angeles',
              db.insert = FALSE, 
              google.push = FALSE)

```

Once again, the field names on the returned data.table object look slightly different from those returned by a call to `scheduleFixed()` when working with the database. There are no *locationID* or *equipmentID* columns because we are not linked with a database, and the column names are formatted for direct use with the Google Calendar API (e.g., "Start Date" instead of "startDate", "Location" instead of "locationID"). If desired, we could save this output to an R object, write it to a CSV, and manually load it into a Google Calendar ourselves (or apply it to other uses).

# Working with the Google Calendar API 

As mentioned in Chapter 7, you should have one primary Google account which is not connected to a piece of monitoring equipment, through which you will manage the Google Calendar API described below. The primary Google account will also be used to manage the Dropbox API covered in Chapter 11: Recordings. Meanwhile, each piece of smartphone-based monitoring equipment will have its own Google account independent of the primary account. 

To illustrate, we begin by viewing the first few records of the **accounts** table:

```{r}
# Retrieve sample data stored in the accounts table
accounts <- RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx,
                                statement = "SELECT * 
                                             FROM accounts;")

# Display the first 10 records and a few selected columns
accounts[1:10, c(1:4,8)]
```

Notice that several Google accounts have been created for smartphone-based monitoring, and one Google account, "midEarthMgt", is designated as the primary Account ('primaryAccount' = 1). The remaining Google accounts are secondary accounts.

To send monitoring schedules directly to a Google Calendar using **AMMonitor**, you must first complete two steps: 1) set up a Google API service account that is associated with the primary management account, and 2) share the main Google Calendar of each smartphone device with this service account. 

Begin by navigating to the Google API development dashboard at: [ https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/calendar/overview]( https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/calendar/overview). This link will take you to any Google account you are currently logged into, **so make sure you are logged into the primary Google account connected to a smartphone used in your monitoring program.** 

## Step 1: Setting up a Google API Service Account



1. Once you have logged into your principal smartphone monitoring account and opened [ https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/calendar/overview](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/calendar/overview), you should accept any welcome pop-ups and Terms of Service notifications. Then, you will see a Google API Developer's screen like the one below. Click "Enable".

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-1-step-2.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.2. Log into your main Google account, and then enable the calendar API.*



2. On the left-hand tab, select "Credentials", and then "Create".

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-1-step-3.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.3. Create credentials.*


3. You will arrive at a new project landing page that looks like the one below. Choose a project name, then click "Create".

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-1-step-4.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.4. Give your project name something meaningful.*

4. Click  the blue "Create credentials" button, which will bring up a drop-down menu of options as shown below. Select the "Service Account Key" option. 

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-1-step-6.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.5. Select the "Service account key" option.*

5. Finally, you will arrive at the page that allows you to create a service account key. Under "Service account", select the "New service account" option. Create a name of your choosing in the "Service account name" field (this will also auto-populate the "Service account ID" field). Below, our demonstration service account is named	'AMMonitor\@complete-sprite-213216.iam.gserviceaccount.com'. (COPY THIS SERVICE ACCOUNT NAME onto a Sticky Note or notebook for safekeeping -- you will need it later on in Step 2.)  In the "Role" dropdown menu, choose Project > Owner. Lastly, for "Key type", make sure that the JSON option is selected. Your screen should look something like the one below (though be sure to choose a Service account name meaningful to you). When finished, click "Create".

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-1-step-7.png', dpi = 500)

6. A new dialogue box will prompt an automatic download of the JSON key. On a PC running Windows 10, you will experience a download of the JSON file and a pop up prompting you to store the file in a folder of your choosing. You should navigate to the **settings** folder in your monitoring project directory, and store the file there. This process may vary on different operating systems. Incidentally, the **settings** folder also holds our Dark Sky key from Chapter 8: Temporals.

Incidentally, [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a data format commonly exchanged by internet servers such as Google. You can use a text editor to view the file, where you will see several sets of key-value entries that allow **AMMonitor** functions to connect to the Google accounts of each smartphone.


## Step 2: Sharing the Service Token with Monitoring Equipment

The service account key generated in Step 1 should be associated with your primary Google management account (in our example, the primary management account is "midEarthMgt"). We now need to share each monitoring smartphone's main Google Calendar with this service account by logging into the Google account for each piece of monitoring equipment. 

For example, if we have a piece of equipment named "equip\@4", whose Google account is "midEarth4" in the **accounts** table, then we need to log into that account and navigate to the following web address: [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render#main_7](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render#main_7)


1. Once you have logged into the Google account for an individual piece of monitoring equipment (e.g., "midEarth4") and navigated to [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render#main_7](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render#main_7), accept any Google welcome pop-ups and notifications. Then, in the left-hand pane, select the main calendar account for this device. In the demonstration image below, our main account's name is 'midEarth4'. Select the 3 vertical dots that say "Options for [Name] Account", and then select "Settings and sharing".

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-2-step-1.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.9. If you use smart phones as an autonomous monitoring device, you will need to share each unique account with the main account to allow R to communicate with each piece of equipment.*


2. In the left-hand panel, select "Share with specific people". Then, click "Add people", and paste in the name of the Service Account ID you generated in Step 1.5. Below, our demonstration service account is named	'AMMonitor\@complete-sprite-213216.iam.gserviceaccount.com'. Next, under "Permissions", select "Make changes to events". Finally, click "SEND" to save these settings.

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-2-step-2.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.10. Share the account with specific 'people'.*


3. The settings for your monitoring smartphone's calendar should now look something like the image below. The settings page should contain the device's Google account name (in this example, "midEarth4\@gmail.com (Owner)", followed by the Service Account ID address generated in step 1.5. This action is what allows us to interact with the monitoring device's calendar directly through R functions that use the Google Calendar API.

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/part-2-step-3.png', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.11. The account named 'midearth4' is now shared with the primary account's API.*

You will have to repeat steps 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 for each piece of monitoring equipment for which you would like to conduct remote scheduling. Depending on the number of phones in your program, this may take some time, but you will only need to do this once per phone.

While you are logged in to each monitoring account, you should make sure your monitoring equipment's Google Calendar is set to the timezone in which it is monitoring. For example, if you (and your computer) are located in Vermont, USA, but your study site is located in California, USA, you have a three hour time difference between the monitoring device and your computer (which is communicating the schedule to the device). In this example, if your Google Calendar's schedule is not set to the timezone *in which it is monitoring*, your schedules will unintentionally contain a three hour time difference.

It is fairly easy to use the **AMMonitor** functions to create either sun-based or fixed schedules, but take care to set up the Google API correctly. 

When finished with the day's work, we disconnect from the database.
```{r}
# Disconnect from the database
RSQLite::dbDisconnect(conx)
```

# The Schedule Table in Access

The schedule form can be accessed in a few different ways. Under the Locations primary tab, the **schedule** table is located as a secondary tab. 

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%',echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap9_Figs/schedule.PNG', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 9.13. The schedule table in Access is located under the primary tab, Locations. It is populated with AMMonitor functions and should not be edited by hand.*

The data are displayed in red to remind users that schedules are generated in R, and should not edited directly. 

# Chapter Summary

This chapter covered the **schedule** table, with which users interact via the `scheduleFixed()` or `scheduleSun()` functions, which can be used to generate either fixed or sun-based recording schedules at active monitoring locations. Both functions offer a variety of options for schedule customization, and each provides the opportunity to schedule recording events directly to an equipment's Google Calendar via the Google Calendar API. In the next chapter, we introduce a third schedule function, `scheduleOptim()`, which can be used to set schedules that have been optimized according to the weather forecast and target species activity models.
