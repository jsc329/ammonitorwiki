## Chapter 4: The Species, Library, and Lists Tables

This chapter covers the **species**, **library**, **lists**, and **listItems** tables in the **AMMonitor** database. The **species** and **library** tables can be used to track groups of target monitoring species, as well as the sounds by which they are detected and monitored. The **lists** and **listItems** tables allow users to create lists of items, which can be used to enhance the integrity of the database. 

In this chapter, we will use `dbCreateSample()` to create a database called "Chap4.sqlite", which will be stored in a folder (directory) called "database" within the **AMMonitor** main directory, which should be your working directory in R. Recall that `dbCreateSample()` generates all tables of an **AMMonitor** database, and then pre-populates sample data into tables specified by the user. For demonstration purposes in this chapter, we will only pre-populate the **species**, **lists**, **listItems**, and **library** tables.

```{r}
# Create a sample database for this chapter
dbCreateSample(db.name = "Chap4.sqlite", 
               file.path = paste0(getwd(),"/database"), 
               tables =  c("species", "lists", "listItems", "library"))
```

Next, we connect to the database with RSQLite's `dbConnect()` function, where we must identify the SQLite driver in the 'drv' argument:

```{r}
# Establish the database file path as db.path
db.path <- paste0(getwd(), '/database/Chap4.sqlite')

# Connect to the database
conx <- RSQLite::dbConnect(drv = dbDriver('SQLite'), dbname = db.path)
```

Finally, we send a SQL statement that will enforce foreign key constraints. 

```{r}
# Turn the SQLite foreign constraints on
RSQLite::dbSendQuery(conn = conx, statement = 
              "PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;"
          )
```
The output of this query indicates that 0 rows of data were returned or changed, but that the foreign key constraint has been enabled. We will return to this topic below.


### The Species Table in R
The **species** table stores all species of monitoring interest, with the option to link each species' Integrated Taxonomic Information System [ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/) number for standardized species tracking. 

We invoke `dbTables()` to see the schema for the **species** table, noting that most of the fields are of the VARCHAR data type (storing up to 255 characters). The *notes* column is TEXT data type, and more than 255 characters may be entered. A *speciesID* is required because it is the table's primary key. 
```{r}
# Look at information about the species table
dbTables(db.path = db.path, table = "species")
```

#### Reading records

If we are confident that the **species** table is small enough to read into memory, we can use `dbReadTable()` to read the entire table into R, specifying the **conx** object in the 'conn' argument, and "species" as the table of interest in the 'name' argument. 
```{r}
# Read the entire table and store as get.species
get.species <- RSQLite::dbReadTable(conn = conx, name = "species")

# Look at the entire table (printed as a tibble)
get.species
```

Recall that the SQLite query is returned as a data.frame:

```{r}
class(get.species)
```

Alternatively, we can invoke `dbGetQuery()`, using a '\*' symbol in the SQLite statement to indicate that we want to select all columns. The statement below also ensures that we select all rows. 
```{r, eval = F}
# Retrieve all columns and rows from the species table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT * FROM species")
```

The *speciesID*, which is the primary key, can be any type of code meaningful to users of the monitoring program. For example, as demonstrated above, researchers monitoring birds might elect to use standard [four or six-letter alpha codes](https://www.birdpop.org/pages/birdSpeciesCodes.php) familiar to many bird monitoring programs. The *commonName* records the species common name, while *genus* and *species* combine to provide consistent taxonomic information about the species. The *notes* column can be used to include any additional desired information. 

The [*ITIS* number](https://www.itis.gov/) is a unique number assigned to each taxa in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, which provides authoritative taxonomic information on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of North America and the world. ITIS partners with Species 2000 and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and provides the taxonomic backbone to the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). Storing the ITIS number of focal monitoring species can aid in standardization and collaboration across monitoring efforts. 

The R package **taxize** [@taxize] provides a convenient method for accessing taxonomic information across the web. 

```{r, eval = F}
# Install the package taxize to link to the ITIS database
install.packages(taxize)

# Load the taxize package
library(taxize)
```

We can retrieve information about any species stored in the ITIS database by providing its taxonomic species number (TSN). The TSN can be found using the `get_ids()` function.
```{r}
get_ids(names = "Black-tailed Gnatcatcher", db = "itis")
```
Once the TSN is known, the **taxize** function `itis_getrecord()` retrieves information stored in the ITIS database when the species taxonomic species number (TSN) is provided in the 'values' argument. 
```{r}
# Retrieve the Black-tailed Gnatcatcher ITIS TSN (taxonomic species number)
gnatcatcher <- taxize::itis_getrecord(values = '179857')

# The returned record contains taxonomic information stored in a list
str(gnatcatcher, max.level = 1)
 
```

A wealth of information is returned for the species, formatted as a list of lists. 

#### Creating records

As demonstrated in Chapter 3, the easiest way to add records to the database in R is to generate a data.frame of records, and then use `dbWriteTable()` to insert them. We demonstrate with a data.frame of one record, ensuring that all column names in the data.frame exactly match the field names in the database itself, and making sure that the data types in the data.frame match those expected by the database. We then add the contents of this data.frame directly to the species table in the database using `dbWriteTable()`, ensuring that 'overwrite' = FALSE and 'append' = TRUE.
```{r}
# Generate a new record
new.species <- data.frame(speciesID = 'phaino', 
                          commonName = 'Phainopepla',
                          ITIS = NA,
                          genus = 'Phainopepla',
                          species = 'nitens',
                          notes = NA, 
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Add the record to the database
RSQLite::dbWriteTable(conn = conx, name = 'species', value = new.species,
             row.names = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE,
             append = TRUE, header = FALSE)
```

#### Updating records

To modify information in an existing record in R, we use an UPDATE statement in `dbExecute()`, ensuring that any VARCHAR or TEXT values are enclosed in quotes. Below, we pass a SQL statement that finds all records in **species** where *commonName* is equal to Phainopepla, and modify the *speciesID* to become 'phai':

```{r}
# Update speciesID for Phainopepla
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, statement = 
              "UPDATE species 
               SET speciesID = 'phai'
               WHERE commonName = 'Phainopepla' "
          )
```
This action returns a "1" to convey that 1 record was updated. We can also make updates using `dbWriteTable()` by storing the record to be updated as a data.frame, and then passing in TRUE for the 'overwrite' argument. 

We can use `dbGetQuery()` to check that our Phainopepla *speciesID* modification was successful: 
```{r}
# Check on the table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT * FROM species")
```

Note that *speciesID* is the primary key for the species table, and it has just been updated. As mentioned in Chapter 2, an **AMMonitor** database invokes "cascade updates;" when a primary key is altered, entries in other tables that utilize this primary key will automatically be updated, ensuring that the integrity of the database is maintained. 

####  Deleting records 
To delete specific records from a table, we again invoke `dbExecute()`, this time with a DELETE statement. Below, we combine the DELETE statement with a WHERE statement to eliminate any records containing 'Phainopepla' in the *genus* column: 
```{r}
# Get rid of Gimli record
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, statement = "DELETE FROM species 
          WHERE genus = 'Phainopepla' ")
```
This operation returns a "1" to indicate that one record was deleted from the table. We can confirm this with a SELECT COUNT(*) command, and count the number of records in the species table.  
```{r}
# Check on the table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM species")
```

The query returns the number 9, indicating that our table now contains 9 records. 

**Records should be deleted with extreme care.** As mentioned in Chapter 2, an **AMMonitor** database does not invoke "cascade delete;" when a record is deleted, entries in other tables that utilize the primary key of the deleted record will not be automatically be deleted. For example, if we delete the record with *speciesID* = "phai" from the **species** table, we may produce dangling records in other tables that reference the *speciesID* "phai" (e.g., tables **annotations**, **speciesList**, **templates**). These tables may reference "phai" as the *speciesID*, but the key now cannot be traced back the parent table. When deleting records, it is the user's responsibility to delete downstream records if desired.

### The Library Table in R

For acoustic monitoring programs, all target monitoring species will have target sound signals by which they can be positively identified to the species level. Some target monitoring species may have multiple call types, so we might choose to track multiple signals from a single species. All target signals from target monitoring species are named and briefly described in the **library** table. The actual signals of interest are stored in the **templates** table, described in Chapter 15.

`dbTables()` provides a summary of the field names and data types in the library table. Below, we note that the library table has four fields, all characters (limited to 255 entries) or text (unlimited in size). The *libraryID* is the primary key. The *notnull* = 1 column indicates that both a *libraryID* and a *speciesID* are strictly required in *any* record added to the **library** table. 
```{r}
# Look at information about the library table
dbTables(db.path = db.path, table = "library")
```

Importantly, the *speciesID* column is a *foreign key*:  The *speciesID* column in the **library** table is mapped to the *speciesID* column in the **species** table, and referential integrity is enforced. This can be confirmed with the following code:

```{r, eval = T}
# Return foreign key information for the speciesList table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "PRAGMA foreign_key_list(library);")

```

Thus, any attempt to enter a new library record that does have an entry in the **species** table will throw an error. Human-made sounds that may be of monitoring interest, such as mechanical sounds [@Mporas2016],  traffic, or others, should be be connected to a "Homo sapiens" record (TSN 180092) in the **species** table.

We can view the contents of the sample **library** table using either `dbReadTable()` or the more customizable `dbGetQuery()`:
```{r}
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT * FROM library
           LIMIT 5")
```

The *libraryID* denotes a unique ID for each target signal. In rows 1 and 2 of the **library** object, note that the *speciesID* is 'btgn' for both rows. This means we are tracking multiple  vocalization types for the same species. The 'btgn_zhee' record tracks the Black-tailed Gnatcatcher's typical territorial "zhee zhee zhee" advertisement sound. The 'btgn_other' record will serve as a catch-all for any other unspecified Black-tailed Gnatcatcher sound types (it is useful to include such generalized "species_other" records for annotation purposes; these grant annotators the capacity to flag any unanticipated or atypical sounds a species may make; See Chapter 14). We elected to name each *libraryID* by attaching the speciesID at the front, but we could have chosen to name these signals according to any convention. The third column, *type*, is not required, but furnishes the opportunity to distinguish the signal type (if useful). For example, bird sounds are often categorized as songs or calls. Lastly, the *description* column can contain information describing the signal of interest, but is not required.

### The List and listItems Tables in R

The **list** table simply stores the names of lists; ultimately each list is a collection of items, like a menu, which are stored in the **listItems** table. A list here means a general list of items that have some sort of grouping; it is not an object of class "list" in R. 

Lists provide a flexible way to enforce structure in a database. To illustrate, soon we will view a list called "Frodo's List" which identifies all of the species for which Frodo has expertise. Furthermore, a list can be used to create a drop-down in the **AMMonitor** Access form, restricting users to select items from the list instead of choosing their own entries. For example, when adding a new record to the **people** table (which has a column called "projectRole"), we may generate a list called "projectRole" and create entries for it, such as "PI", "Lead-Ring Monitor",and "Field Technician". This list can be linked to the Access form's field "projectRole", forcing users to select from this an entry from the list. See [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-list-of-choices-by-using-a-list-box-or-combo-box-70abf4a9-0439-4885-9099-b9fa83517603#__toc356995225) for more information.

`dbTables()` provides a summary of the field names and data types in the **lists** table. 

```{r}
# Look at schema for the speciesList table
dbTables(db.path = db.path, table = "lists")
```

This table has only two fields; the *listID* field serves as the primary key, and *description* field stores a brief description of what the list will hold. We can view the contents of the sample **lists** table with `dbReadTable()`:

```{r}
# Return  the lists table from the database (shown as a tibble)
RSQLite::dbReadTable(conn = conx, name = "lists")
```

Our **lists** table identifies six lists. The descriptions indicate that five of these are lists of species (subsets of the **species** table), while the sixth is a list of templates used for automatic scanning of audio recordings (See Chapter 15).

To see the items associated with a given list, we can query the **listItems** table:

```{r}
# Return  the listItems table from the database (shown as a tibble)
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT * 
                                     FROM listItems
                                     WHERE listID = 'Frodo''s List' ")
```

Here, we see a list called "Frodo's List" containing three items (ecdo, gaqu, and verd). These items originate from the *speciesID* column in the **species** table. Notice also the double apostrophe used in the SQLite query to avoid issues with the quote in "Frodo's list". 

"Frodo's List" contains the three speciesIDs that indicate the species for which Frodo is an expert. "Bilbo's List" contains five species. These lists will be explained in Chapter 14: Annotations, where we will illustrate how Frodo can annotate an audio recording or photo, focusing  attention on only those species within "Frodo's List"; in doing so, he will indicate the presence or absence of three species for each file he annotates. In contrast, when Bilbo annotates a file, he will be focusing on five species in which he has expertise. Thus, the **listItems** table allows different members of a monitoring team to have unique expertise. 

Importantly, all entries in the *listID* column must match a *listID* present in the **lists** table. The field *listID* in the **listItems** table is foreign key that references a primary key in another table. We confirm this with the following statement:   

```{r, eval = T}
# Return foreign key information for the listItems table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "PRAGMA foreign_key_list(listItems);")

```
Resulting output shows that the field *listID* from the table **listItems** maps to the field *listID* in the table **lists**. Note the *on_update* column value is set to "CASCADE", indicating that when a primary key in the **lists** table is changed, the mapped keys in the **listItems** table will be automatically updated. For example, if we change the primary key "Frodo's List" to "FrodoList" in the **lists** table, it will also be updated to "FrodoList" in the **listItems** table. 

Also note that the *on_delete* column value is set to "NO ACTION", indicating that when a primary key is deleted from the **lists** table, no records will be removed from the linked **listItems** table.

Because of the foreign key constraint, a user may not add records to the **listItems** table if a *listID* is not present in the **lists** table, as we illustrate with the following example:  

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Insert a new record using SQL syntax; note that it will fail
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, statement = 
               "INSERT INTO listItems (
                  listID, 
                  dbTable,
                  dbColumn,
                  item
                  )
                VALUES (
                  'Gandalf''s List',
                  null,
                  null,
                  'orc'
                  )"
          
) # close the dbExecute statement
```

Note, however, that if "Gandalf's List" did exist, this entry would have been acceptable even though 'orc' is not listed in the **species** table. List items can be mostly anything so long as a **listID** exists in the **lists** table. The columns *dbTable* and *dbColumn* are not enforced in the table *per se*, but are useful for tracking items if desired. (Note: the can be enforced through the Microsoft Access front-end if desired.) 

When you are finished with your **AMMonitor** session, make sure to disconnect from the database:
```{r}

# Disconnect from the database
RSQLite::dbDisconnect(conx)

```

###  The Species and Library Tables in Access

The **species** table plays a prominent role in **AMMonitor**, and as such is primary tab in the  Access front-end. Selecting the species tab displays the species form, with each form element tagged to a specific column in the **species** table. Further, the **library** form is nested within the **species** form, providing a convenient way to view all library items associated with a given species.

```{r, out.width = 700, out.height = 400, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap4_Figs/species.PNG', dpi = 500)
```

Notice that the library is also a secondary tab under the Species primary tab. This facilitates more generic searching.

###  The List and listItems Tables in Access

Because lists are so flexible, used in many different capacities in **AMMonitor**, they are listed as a sub-tab under the "Program Mgt" tab. Here, Bilbo's list is displayed on the **list** form (in which listID and description are tagged to the table's columns). The **listItems** form is nested within the **lists** form, providing an easy way to create, read, update, or delete records for any given list.

```{r, out.width = 700, out.height = 400, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap4_Figs/lists.PNG', dpi = 500)
```

Notice at the bottom of this form that Bilbo's List is record 1 of 6 (six lists come with the sample database). We can use the scroll arrows to view other lists, and click on the "sunny" button to create a new list and add new items to it. 


### Chapter Summary

In this chapter, you learned about the **species** and **library** tables. The species table allows species to be identified by ITIS number -- useful if you plan on sharing your data in any way. The **library** table allows the monitoring team to identify different signals issued by a species. These signals will be the subject of Chapter 15: Templates.

You also learned about **lists** and **listItems**, tables that can be used for multiple purposes in an **AMMonitor** framework. We use lists in many of the coming chapters.
