# Chapter Introduction

The **people** table in an **AMMonitor** SQLite database tracks information about all members involved in a monitoring program. In addition to providing a convenient contact book, this table is used to identify project members who annotate species presence or absence in an audio or image file, or who deploy monitoring equipment at a monitoring station. 

For this chapter, we will use `dbCreateSample()` to create a database called "Chap3.sqlite", which will be stored in a folder (directory) called **database** within the **AMMonitor** main directory, which should be your working directory in R. Recall that `dbCreateSample()` generates all tables of an **AMMonitor** database, and then pre-populates sample data into tables specified by the user. For demonstration purposes in this chapter, we will only pre-populate the **people** table. 
  
```{r}
# Create a sample database for this chapter
dbCreateSample(db.name = "Chap3.sqlite", 
               file.path = paste0(getwd(),"/database"), 
               tables =  "people")
```


Next, we connect to the database with RSQLite's `dbConnect()` function, where we must identify the SQLite driver in the 'drv' argument:

```{r}
# Establish the database file path as db.path
db.path <- paste0(getwd(), '/database/Chap3.sqlite')

# Connect to the database
conx <- RSQLite::dbConnect(drv = dbDriver('SQLite'), dbname = db.path)
```

Finally, we send a SQL statement that will enforce foreign key constraints:

```{r}
# Turn the SQLite foreign constraints on
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, statement = "PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;")
```

The `dbTables()` function provides the table schema for any table in the database, such as primary keys, column names, the type of information stored, and default values. We point to the database by inputting the **db.path** object to the 'db.path' argument, and indicate "people" as the table of interest in the 'table' argument:

```{r}
# Look at information about the people table
dbTables(db.path = db.path, table = "people")

```

`dbTables()` returns a list of table schemas, in this case, a list of 1, which contains a data.frame of information about the **people** table. The *cid* column indicates the column (field) number; *name* indicates the column name; *type* conveys the data type for that column as contained within the underlying SQLite database. Thus, the **people** table consists of six fields (columns): "personID", "firstName", "lastName", "projectRole", "email", and "phone". Each field stores VARCHAR (variable character length) data, storing up to 255 characters. In R, VARCHAR data are of class "character". The *notnull* column indicates whether an entry is required for that field; if 1, an entry is required (in the people table, for example, no new record can be created without adding a personID, though remaining fields may be left blank). A column's *dflt_value* specifies the default value is used for that field (NA indicates no default value). 

Lastly, *pk* indicates whether the field is a primary key. In the **people** table, *personID* is the primary key. This is the single, unique identifier that points to a specific person in the **people** table, and with very few exceptions should **never be changed or deleted** or the integrity of the data in other tables may be compromised.

# "CRUD" operations in R


## Reading records

To view the contents of an existing table using R, we have a few options. If the table is relatively small, we can use the RSQLite function `dbReadTable()` to read the entire table into R's memory, again specifying our **conx** object in the 'conn' argument, and "people" as the table of interest in the 'name' argument. 
```{r}
# Read the entire table and store as get.people
get.people <- RSQLite::dbReadTable(conn = conx, name = "people")

# Look at the entire table (printed as a tibble)
get.people
```

The *personID* is the primary key of this table, and uniquely identifies each record in the **people** table. Duplicate *personID*s are not allowed. Above, we have chosen the convention of combining the first initial with the last name with no separating spaces. 

Notice that once this information object is read from SQLite into R, it can be treated as a typical R data.frame. We can use the `class()` function to confirm that the **get.people** object is a data.frame.
```{r}
class(get.people)
```

As an alternative to the `dbReadTable()` function, we can query certain fields and records of the table using SQL syntax. This is a useful approach if we only need specific types of information from the **people** table, or if we suspect the table is quite large and do not want to read all of it into memory within R. The **people** table is not likely to become especially large, but the option to query tables directly using SQL syntax will be useful when we encounter larger tables later on. 

We use the `dbGetQuery()` function to query database tables and return records of interest. Yet again, we specify our **conx** object in the 'conn' argument. In the 'statement' argument, we provide a character string that passes the SQL instructions for querying the database. The online [**SQLite Tutorial**](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) provides help for how these SQL character string queries should be structured, and we will step through a few examples below.

To select the entire table, we use the SQL command "SELECT * FROM people", where the '\*' in our character string indicates that we want to return all fields (columns) of the table. The simple statement below gives no identifying information about which records (rows) should be returned, so all records will be selected and returned:
```{r}
# Use * to select all rows and columns of the people table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                    statement = "SELECT * 
                                 FROM people")
```

To only look at the first record, we can add the statement "LIMIT 1" to the end of our character string (if we had many records and only wanted to see the first 12, we could use, e.g., "LIMIT 12"):
```{r}
# Only look at the first  record
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                    statement = "SELECT * 
                                 FROM people 
                                 LIMIT 1")
```

If we only want to return information on a particular column, we can name that column specifically in the SQLite character string instead of using the '\*' symbol. Below, we demonstrate using the *firstName* column:
```{r}
# Only look at the firstName column
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                    statement = "SELECT firstName 
                                 FROM people")
```

More complex queries can be constructed depending on the information needed. Next, we query all columns, but introduce a **where** statement to indicate that we only want records where the first name is equal to 'Frodo'. We have to add single quotes around 'Frodo' because it is a character. 
```{r}
# Only select records with "Frodo" in the firstName column
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                    statement = "SELECT * 
                                 FROM people 
                                 WHERE firstName = 'Frodo' ") 
```

As with `dbReadTable()`, results returned from `dbGetQuery()` can be stored as a data.frame for further manipulation in R. 

Note that both the `dbReadTable()` and `dbGetQuery()` functions require you be be actively connected to the database via a **conx** object in order to return table information. Depending on your workflow, it may be more useful to avoid creating a **conx** object in order to avert database conflicts among multiple users. In this case, you may opt to use the **AMMonitor** `qry()` function, which only requires a **db.path** object input to the 'db.path' argument, and either a table name input to the 'table' argument (if you wish to read an entire table into memory), or a SQLite statement input to the 'statement' argument. `qry()` acts as a wrapper function for either `dbReadTable()` or `dbGetQuery()`, and takes care of connecting and disconnecting from the database for you. It returns the results as a data.table in R. The below code shows how you can use `qry()` to read in an entire table, or to use a SQLite statement to select records of interest: 
```{r}

# Read in the entire people table
qry(db.path = db.path, 
    table = 'people')

# Only select records with "Frodo" in the firstName column
qry(db.path = db.path, 
    table = NULL,
    statement = "SELECT * 
                 FROM people 
                 WHERE firstName = 'Frodo' ") 
```

The `qry()` approach is essentially the same as `dbReadTable()` or `dbGetQuery()`, except that it allows you to input a **db.path** object rather than a **conx** object. 

##  Creating records 

The simplest way to add records to the database is to generate a data.frame of records, and then use the `dbWriteTable()` function to insert them. We begin by creating two records, ensuring that all column names in the data.frame exactly match the field names in the database itself. We take care to ensure that the data types in the data.frame match those expected by the database. 

```{r}
# Create a dataframe of records to add
add.people <- data.frame(personID = c('gandalf', 
                                      'saruman'),
                         firstName = c('Gandalf', 
                                       'Saruman'),
                         lastName = c('The Grey', 
                                      'The White'),
                         projectRole = c('Wizard Consultant', 
                                         'Power Seeker'),
                         email = c('gandalf@middle.earth',
                                   'saruman@isengard.net'),
                         phone = c(NA, 
                                   NA))
```
The *personID* is the primary key; it is required and should not duplicate keys that  already exist in the table. The *firstName*, *lastName*, *projectRole*, *email*, and *phone* columns track basic information about each person involved in the monitoring project, though entries for these fields are not required. 

Once we are satisfied with the contents and formatting of our table of new records, we can insert it to the **people** table using the RSQLite function `dbWriteTable()`. In the 'conn' argument we specify the **conx** object, and use 'name' to specify the **people** table. The 'value' we bind is the **add.people** object. We set 'row.name' and 'header' to FALSE because our data.frame does not contain row names or a header. We set 'append' to TRUE in order to add new data to an existing table, and we set 'overwrite' to FALSE to indicate that it will not overwrite existing records.

```{r}
# Bind new records to the people table of the database
RSQLite::dbWriteTable(conn = conx, name = 'people', value = add.people,
             row.names = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE,
             append = TRUE, header = FALSE)

# Check database to confirm new records were added
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                    statement = 'SELECT * FROM people')
```

Alternatively, one can add a new record by constructing an entire character string of SQL syntax and passing it to the RSQLite function `dbExecute()`, using an INSERT statement to identify the table fields and values. Notice that single quotes are required around all of the VARCHAR (character) data values in the statement. Below, we have added tabs and spaces to our statement to make the contents easier to read, but R does not do this automatically, and any long character statements can become cumbersome as a result, making this option more difficult to use: 
```{r}
# Insert a new record using SQLite syntax 
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, 
                   statement = 
               "INSERT INTO people (
                   personID, 
                   firstName, 
                   lastName, 
                   projectRole, 
                   email, 
                   phone
                  )
                VALUES (
                  'gimli',
                  'Gimli',
                  'Son of Gloin',
                  'Support Staff', 
                  'gimli@dwarves.org',
                  '1-800-AND-MYAX'
                  )"
          
) # close the dbExecute statement
```
`dbExecute()` returns a "1" to indicate that one record has been added to the table. We use `dbGetQuery()` to check on all fields and records of the table, confirming that our new records have been added: 
```{r}
# Check on the table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT * FROM people")
```


## Updating records

To modify information in an existing record, we use an UPDATE statement in `dbExecute()`, ensuring that any VARCHAR or TEXT values are enclosed in single quotes. Below, we pass a SQL statement that finds all records where *lastName* is equal to Baggins, and modify those phone numbers to become 1-800-shire:
```{r}
# Update cell phones for anyone with last name baggins:
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, 
                   statement = "UPDATE people 
                                SET phone = '1-800-shire'
                                WHERE LastName = 'Baggins' ")
```
This action returns a "2" to convey that 2 records were updated. 

Again, we can use `dbGetQuery()` to check that our Baggins phone number updates were successful: 
```{r}
# Check on the table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, 
                    statement = "SELECT * 
                                 FROM people 
                                 WHERE lastName = 'Baggins'")
```

##  Deleting records 
To delete specific records from a table, we again invoke the `dbExecute()` function, this time with a DELETE statement. Below, we combine the DELETE statement with a WHERE statement to delete any records containing 'Gimli' in the *firstName* column: 
```{r}
# Remove the Gimli record
RSQLite::dbExecute(conn = conx, 
                   statement = "DELETE FROM people 
                                WHERE firstName = 'Gimli' ")
```

Another call to `dbGetQuery()` confirms that our deletion was successful: 
```{r}
# Check on the table
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(conn = conx, statement = "SELECT * FROM people")
```

**Note that records should be deleted with extreme care.** As mentioned in Chapter 2, an **AMMonitor** database does not invoke "cascade delete;" when a record is deleted, entries in other tables that use the primary key of the deleted record will not be automatically be deleted. In this case, if we delete "Gimli" from the **people** table, we may produce dangling records that reference Gimli in other tables. For example, if Gimli spent time annotating recordings for presence or absence of focal species [See Chapter 14], his *personID* would be contained in the **annotations** table, but his corresponding personal information would no longer be present in the **people** table. 

Finally, we disconnect from the database when finished with modifications:
```{r}
# Disconnect from the database
RSQLite::dbDisconnect(conx)
```

#  "CRUD" operations in Access

Figure 3.1 shows the **AMMonitor** Access front end, which is a Navigation Form in Access (a form containing many forms). The top of the form consists of primary tabs (3.1a), including Program Mgt, Objectives, Species, Locations, Recordings, and Photos. When a primary tab is selected (e.g., the Program Mgt tab has been selected), the left menu displays a set of secondary tabs (3.1b). Thus, "People" fall under the realm of Program Mgt (3.1c). 

<kbd>

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = F, fig.align = 'left'}

knitr::include_graphics('Chap3_Figs/NavigationForm.PNG', dpi = 500)
```

</kbd>

>*Figure 3.1.  The People form is located under the Program Mgt primary tab.

This table's fields are displayed in a form-like view above, and can alternatively be displayed in a spreadsheet view. As previously mentioned, the **people** table consists of six columns (fields), and a single record is displayed in the form (3.1d). Now let's take a look at CRUD operations in Access:

- **C**reate a new record by pressing the sun icon button (3.1f), and fill in the fields. 
- **R**ead a record is simply viewing an existing record, such as the one displayed in Figure 3.1. Toward the bottom of the form, we can advance from record to record using the arrow buttons (3.1e).
- **U**pdate a record by simply changing an entry in the form. Then, move from the current record by pressing either the back or forward arrows (Figure 3.1e). 
- **D**eleting records in the **AMMonitor** database should be done with caution, for the reasons outlined above. Thus, we have not included a 'delete' button in the Access form. However, if you must delete records, you can highlight the records of interest in the linked tables, and then press Delete on your keyboard. **Always remember:  if you delete a record that is used downstream in other tables, it is up to you to determine how you will maintain the integrity of downstream data!**  Your monitoring program should establish standards for how the team will handle deletions. 


#  Chapter Summary

This chapter was a brief introduction to the **people** table in an **AMMonitor** SQLite database. People play a vital role in the monitoring effort, deploying equipment, annotating files, creating templates, and more. You may interact with this table via R by using the `dbReadTable()`, `dbWriteTable()`, `dbGetQuery()`, or `dbExecute()` functions. We also introduced a few SQL commands that can be used to create, read, update, or delete records from a database table. Results from these functions are stored in R as data.frames, where you can manipulate the data further as you wish. You may also interact with this table via the Access front end.
